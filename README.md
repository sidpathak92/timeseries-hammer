Meant to be a central repo for generic ts toying functions

This repo is the result of being frustrated over being unable to find straight forward simple functions to categorize, break, splice, split time series data. Pandas groupby function is one of the un-intuitive functions for trying to get back grouped dataframes per conditions you provide.

This repo is intended to be updated everytime I come close to breaking my head trying to attempt a very simple thing to be done, but being forced to write my own functions for it. The products of my frustrations (the functions) are going to be dumped here.

Also Bigfoot is real.
